# epaper Crypto ticker

I had the idea to create a crypto ticker so I can monitor how the market is doing without needing my main computers to be on. To accomplish this, I bought an epaper display hat for a raspberry pi:

[PapiRus with 2.7in E-Ink Display](https://au.rs-online.com/web/p/raspberry-pi-screens/1218357/)

Using the install instructions linked on the store page [PapiRus on GitHub](https://github.com/PiSupply/PaPiRus) to install the drivers on the pi.

I found another GitHub project [schech1/BTCDisplay](https://github.com/schech1/BTCDisplay) that is doing most of what I am after, so I started with their code.
